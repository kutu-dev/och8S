# TODO

- Move `src/headers` to `./include`.
- Fix quirks test, remember!: The screen shows you if the following quirks are detected as active ("on", "off" or an error) and if that matches your chosen target platform (a checkmark or a cross).
- Correctly handle passing over the limits of the screen.
- Fix [timing](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#timing).
- Add sound.
- Change `puts` to a proper logging system.
