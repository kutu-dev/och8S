# TODO

- Add sound.
- Dynamic allocated PC stack.
- Save States (with infinite slots and quick access to 0-9 with the keyboard) (With preview? in a toast? maybe a plain texture is enough).
    - That may imply that a toast notification should be implemented (and its out of scope).
- Debug granular system.
